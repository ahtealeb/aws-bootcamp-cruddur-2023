## Required Homework/Tasks
## Getting the AWS CLI Working
##### We'll be using the AWS CLI often in this bootcamp, so we'll proceed to installing this account.

## Install AWS CLI

##### We are are going to set AWS CLI to use partial autoprompt mode to make it easier to debug CLI commands.

```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```
I attempted to run the command by typing in <em>aws</em> but I recieved an error

```
C:\Users\moi>aws
'aws' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```
I was able to resolve the error by closing command prompt, and opening it again.

## Create a Budget
I created my own Budget for $1 because I cannot afford any kind of spend. I did not create a second Budget because I was concerned of 
budget spending going over the 2 budget free limit.
